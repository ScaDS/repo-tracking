# ScaDS.AI Code, Data and Model Repositories

This Jupyter Book contains 194 links to code / data / models and other materials by members of ScaDS.AI published e.g. on Zenodo or Github. Last updated: 2025-12-18.

This is a **preliminary** / **experimental** search index allowing us to explore how such a database could look like. We follow the principle [_release early, release often_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often) and aim at having a functional prototype of the index at any time. We will use this resource to 
* explore what kind of meta-data we need to collect for our materials
* how we can automatically collect links to materials
* how we could potentially inject our list of materials into the other indices
* how to collect links to materials following the FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable)

Feedback and contributions are very welcome, e.g. as [github issue](https://github.com/scads/zenodo-tracking/issues).
