In this slide-deck we dive into large language models for bioimage data science, focusing on code generation for bio image analysis. The slides also give an outlook on how AI-systems may change data analysis in the future through data analysis code generation.

This jupyter-based and voilá-ready prompting app gives the ability to use an api key for prompting workshops with an unlimited number of participants (while keeping in mind that some models cost per request). It bridges the temporary situation that there are no institutional LLM accesses yet and solutions such as GPTX are still a work in progress.
