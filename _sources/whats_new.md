## How LLMs impact BioImage Data Science

Haase, Robert

Published 2025-11-21

Licensed cc-by-4.0



In this slide-deck we dive into large language models for bioimage data science, focusing on code generation for bio image analysis. The slides also give an outlook on how AI-systems may change data analysis in the future through data analysis code generation.

## Socio-Technical Anti-Patterns in Building ML-Enabled Software (Supplementary Material)

Mailach, Alina, Siegmund, Norbert

Published 2023-01-18

Licensed cc-by-4.0



This material documents the coding process and theme evolution for the reflexive thematic analysis conducted in the paper &nbsp;&quot;Socio-Technical Anti-Patterns in Building ML-Enabled Software&quot;, published at International Conference on&nbsp;Software Engineering, 2023. The provided codes and themes&nbsp;represent&nbsp;an intermediate stage of our work, where the file&nbsp;&nbsp;initial_themes.pdf&nbsp;holds initial themes and codes and interim_and_final_themes.xlsx&nbsp;depicts more evolved themes and codes as well as a tracing of which codes belong&nbsp;to which&nbsp;themes. The themes developed over time and represent development contexts and activities, containing anti-patterns, causes, and recommendations.&nbsp;We had not fully developed anti-patterns during the coding process, but&nbsp;rather used symptoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;
