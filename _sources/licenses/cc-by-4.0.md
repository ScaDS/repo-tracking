The Datasets for the Information Retrieval Course at the University Leipzig and Jena in Summer Term 2023
This repository contains resources coupled to ir_datasets and TIREx for IR courses that focus their hands-on labs on shared tasks. During the IR exercises in summer term 2023, we collaboratively developed and evaluated IR systems in a shared task style setup, covering corpus creation, system development, and statistical analysis. The resulting artifacts, i.e., the documents, topics, runs, relevance judgments can be browsed at https://tira-io.github.io/ir-lab-sose-23. This zenodo artifact contains all of the underlying datasets used and produced during the course together with instructions on how to easily access the data using ir_datasets.
Overview of resources
This dataset contains the resources used and created during the IR course at https://temir.org/teaching/information-retrieval-ss23/information-retrieval-ss23.html.
The artifact contains the following files:

&nbsp;iranthology-20230618-training-inputs.zip containing the inputs to systems, i.e., containing the document corpus and the topics.
iranthology-20230618-training-truths.zip containing the truth to evaluate and tune systems, i.e., the topics and relevance judgments.

&nbsp;Accessing the Data with ir_datasets
We provide wrapper code to easily access the resources with ir_datasets:

## Same Side Stance Classification Adversarial Test Cases

Ahmad Dawar Hakimi, Erik Körner, Gregor Wiedemann, Gerhard Heyer, Martin Potthast

Published 2021-09-09

Licensed cc-by-4.0



This dataset contains 175 cases. It is manually created to reveal the ability of models to solve different types of adversarial cases for same side stance predictions more systematically. The examples selected here are derived from the dataset used in the Same Side Stance Classification shared task.

We have selected 25 distinct arguments from the &quot;gay marriage&quot; topic that are short and express their stance clearly. For each selected argument, we construct new arguments of four distinct types to obtain two pairs, one with the same stance, and one with an opposing stance:


	Negation: a simple negation of the argument.
	Paraphrase: alters important words from the argument to synonymous expressions with the same stance.
	Argument: uses an argument from the same topic and stance, but semantically completely different regarding the first one.
	Citation: repeats or summarizes the first argument and then expresses agreement or rejection (a case frequently occurring in the dataset).


The types Paraphrase, Argument, and Citation are also formulated in a negated version to create additional test instances for the opposite stance.

SR4CS: Systematic Reviews for Computer Science&nbsp;
SR4CS is a benchmark dataset linking computer science systematic reviews (SRs) to their reported Boolean queries and curated reference pools, enabling reproducible research on Boolean query generation, retrieval effectiveness, and screening beyond the biomedical domain.


Total SRs: 1,212


Resolved references: 104,316 (incl. 89,447 with abstracts)


Tasks supported: Boolean query generation, retrieval benchmarking, screening


&nbsp;
Paper: tba
Code: https://github.com/webis-de/jcdl25-sr4cs
Contents
1)&nbsp;sr4cs.json
Primary dataset of SR entries.
A&nbsp;list of SR objects:
{
  "id": "1000688",
  "databases": ["Google Scholar", "Scopus", "Web of Science"],
  "search_strings_boolean": [
    "INTITLE (\"green\" OR \"sustainab*\") AND INTITLE (\"AI\" OR \"ML\" OR \"artificial intelligence\" OR \"machine learning\" OR \"deep learning\")"
  ],
  "year_range": "unbounded",
  "language_restrictions": ["English"],

  "snowballing": true,
  "sr_title": "A systematic review of Green AI.",
  "sr_doi": "10.1002/widm.1507",
  "sr_pdf_link": "https://...",
  "ref_id": [86, 113, 114, "..."],
  "num_refs": 97
}
Field summary


id (string): SR identifier (internal).


databases (list[str]): Databases reported in the SR.


search_strings_boolean (list[str]): Reported Boolean queries (verbatim).


year_range (string): Year bounds, e.g., "2018-2022" or "unbounded".


language_restrictions (list[str]): Reported language constraints.


inclusion_criteria / exclusion_criteria (list[str]): As stated in the SR.


topic, objective (string): SR topic &amp; objective (verbatim).


research_questions (list[str]): RQs (verbatim).


snowballing (bool): Whether the SR reports snowballing/citation chasing.


sr_title, sr_doi, sr_pdf_link (metadata for the SR).


ref_id (list[int]): Integer IDs linking to the reference pool.


num_refs (int): Count of linked references for this SR.


2) sr4cs_with_sql.json
Same structure as sr4cs.json, plus translated SQL-style queries for uniform execution:


sqlite_refined_queries (list[str]): SQLite FTS5 MATCH clauses translated from the reported Boolean strings (field-scoped to title/abstract).


3) Reference pool (metadata + abstracts)
The full reference pool is provided in three complementary formats:


refs.db &mdash; SQLite database with FTS5 indexes (ready for querying)


refs.ndjson &mdash; Elasticsearch bulk dump (for index import)


refs.parquet &mdash; Tabular format (not indexed)


Reference fields (columns/keys):
ref_id, arxiv, author, citation-number, collection-title, container-title, date, director, doi, edition, editor, genre, id, isbn, issue, location, note, pages, pmcid, pmid, producer, publisher, raw, source, title, translator, type, url, volume, title_norm, abstract
Notes:


ref_id is the primary key linking SR entries to references.


title_norm is a normalized version of the title (lowercased, standardized spacing/characters) to support matching.


title_norm and abstract are prioritized fields for retrieval.


Many entries also include doi and url.


Abstract coverage is ~89k; the remainder provide title-only metadata.


Intended Use


Boolean query generation: Compare generated queries against transleted expert-reported queries and their retrieval on the shared reference pool.


Retrieval benchmarking: Evaluate title/abstract retrieval engines (e.g., SQLite FTS5, Elasticsearch) on realistic CS SR topics.


Screening experiments: Use the linked reference pools to prototype screening/prioritization pipelines.


Provenance &amp; Construction (summary)


Candidate SRs collected from DBLP by title search for &ldquo;systematic review&rdquo; on 2025-07-03, then filtered (peer-reviewed, OA, DOI, plausible page counts).


PDFs parsed to structured text; SR metadata (databases, queries, criteria, RQs, etc.) extracted and manually checked.&nbsp;


References extracted with a GROBID + AnyStyle pipeline; metadata resolved via Crossref, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, PubMed/Europe PMC; abstracts added where available.


File Inventory


sr4cs.json &mdash; SR entries with reported queries and linkage to reference IDs


sr4cs_with_sql.json &mdash; SR entries plus sqlite_refined_queries (rewritten Boolean queries for SQLite FTS5)


refs.db &mdash; SQLite database with reference metadata (FTS5 indexed)


refs.ndjson &mdash; Elasticsearch bulk dump of references (ready for import)


refs.parquet &mdash; Tabular reference metadata (not indexed)


Known Limitations


Reference coverage is large but not exhaustive; some entries are title-only.


Translated SQL queries approximate original database behavior; engine differences (tokenization, indexing, operators) can affect results.


FAIR &amp; Documentation


Findable: DOI, searchable metadata, stable identifiers (ref_id).


Accessible: Public files (JSON/SQLite/NDJSON).


Interoperable: Common schemas; JSON/SQL; ES bulk format.


Reusable: Development code and usage examples.

## Webis Trigger Warning Corpus 2023

Wiegmann, Wolska, Schröder, Borchardt, Stein, Potthast

Published 2023-05-27

Licensed cc-by-4.0



Abstract&nbsp; &nbsp;A trigger warning or a content warning is intended to enable individuals to make an informed decision about whether to expose themselves to potentially distressing content. We introduce trigger warning assignment as a multilabel classification task and create the Webis&nbsp;Trigger Warning Corpus (WTWC), the first&nbsp;dataset of 1 million fanfiction works from the&nbsp;Archive of our Own with up to 36 different&nbsp;warnings per document. To provide a reliable catalog of trigger warnings, we carefully&nbsp;mapped institutionally-recommended trigger&nbsp;warnings against the millions of free-form tags&nbsp;assigned by fanfiction authors and organized&nbsp;them into the first comprehensive taxonomy of&nbsp;trigger warnings.

Datasets

This repository contains two datasets with word search queries. Each&nbsp;word search query consists of a token n-gram with one&nbsp;wildcard token ([MASK]). The answers to each query are the most likely token to replace the mask. All queries originate from wikitext-103 and CLOTH, the respected source is annotated for each query.

The original-token dataset lists exactly one top answer for each query. The&nbsp;ranked-answers dataset lists multiple, sorted answers in three relevance categories, where 3 is the most relevant. Please refer to the citation for more details.

We present the Webis-STEREO-21 dataset, a massive collection of Scientific Text Reuse in Open-access publications. It contains more than 91 million cases of reused text passages found in 4.2 million unique open-access publications. Featuring a high coverage of scientific disciplines and varieties of reuse, as well as comprehensive metadata to contextualize each case, our dataset addresses the most salient shortcomings of previous ones on scientific writing. Webis-STEREO-21 allows for tackling a wide range of research questions from different scientific backgrounds, facilitating both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the phenomenon as well as a first-time grounding on the base rate of text reuse in scientific publications.

This is the open-access version of the dataset, which includes only the metadata of each reuse case. Due to licensing issues, the matched text is not included.
